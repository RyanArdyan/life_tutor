Let's think about the flow.
1 turor provides many tutorials. this means the relationship is that 1 tutor has many tutorials.
for example john provides a tutorial on how to drive a car, means we need to provide:
table tutorial
0. user_id (1 tutorial belongs to 1 teacher)
1. name
2. number_of_meetings
2. price
3. date
4. time
5. place
6. description
7. image
